WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
This project is a website that I'm going to upload to Neocities.org!
I'm basically testing out how to make some fun HTML pages.
It will be a very basic page, likely just a single index with some styles and JS functions.
The idea is that this page represents a temple, like the kind you'd find in Zelda or maybe Dark Souls, and that it accepts an "offering" from the visitor, which then replaces the previous offering and which they can then view on the page. The point is the aesthetic, really.

WHAT WILL IT DO?
----------------
When opened, the site will display a message reading "new location discovered." 
The site will display a brief text window explaining (crytpically) the nature of the "location."
It will prompt users with a text both (or other input method).
Entries to this prompt will be stored and displayed as an "offering."
The site will display a message thanking the user, which will clear by their next visit.
Users will be able to view the most recent "offering".

CAN I HELP?
-----------
Nope! Not unless I asked you to. But thanks!

THANKS FOR READING!
